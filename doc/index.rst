Welcome to pyxem's documentation!
=================================
Pyxem is an open source project working to bring together tools for the analysis of
data from pixilated electron detectors.  Based on the Hyperspy project, pyxem has an active
community of users who are interested in many different areas including:

- Orientation Mapping of Crystals
- Strain Mapping
- Virtual Dark Field Imaging
- Differential Phase Contrast
- Structural Characterization of Amorphous Materials
- And much more!

Where do I start?
------------------
For most cases starting with one of the linked jupyter notebooks is the
correct place to start.  Otherwise is you are searching for documentation
on some function then you can use the API reference or search the documentation.

The Jupyter Notebooks should give you good workflows for analyzing your dataset

What do I do if I get stuck?
-----------------------------
The first step is looking at the documentation. Often times there will be examples with
the documentation which are good places to start.

If you are still confused after that you can submit an issue on GitHub.


I published some work using pyxem
----------------------------------
If pyxem helped you in publishing some data citing pyxem is very helpful in keeping track
of different papers.  If you are publishing any of the code associated with the project we
would love to link that as further examples for workflows using pyxem.
