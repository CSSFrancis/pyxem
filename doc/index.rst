=================================
Welcome to pyxem's documentation!
=================================

Pyxem is an open source project working to bring together tools for the analysis of
data from pixelated electron detectors. Based on the HyperSpy project, pyxem has an
active community of users and developers who are interested in many different areas
including:

- Orientation Mapping of Crystals
- Strain Mapping
- Virtual Dark Field Imaging
- Differential Phase Contrast
- Structural Characterization of Amorphous Materials
- And much, much more!

Where do I start?
=================

The documentation is split into 4 main sections:

- Examples: A collection of small scripts and snippets of code to help preform common
  operations.
- Tutorials: A collection of tutorials and workflows to help you get started with a wide
  range of analysis techniques. These are more detailed than the examples and are designed
  as complete workflows.
- API Reference: The API reference contains a description of all the functions and classes
  in pyxem. This is useful if you are looking for a specific function or want to know what
  a function does/ what arguments it takes.
- Developer Guide: The developer guide contains information on how to contribute to pyxem
  and gives more information on the internal structure of pyxem.

Additionally, there is a bibliography of papers that have used pyxem and a list of related
projects.

For more information and additional resources, pyxem inherits from HyperSpy, so you can
also check out the `HyperSpy documentation <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/>`_.
All of the HyperSpy documentation is relevant to pyxem, but specifically the
`Big Data <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/dev/user_guide/big_data.html>`_ section has
lots of useful information on how to work with large datasets.

Developers will also find the
`HyperSpy Developer Guide <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/dev/developer_guide/index.html>`_
useful.
